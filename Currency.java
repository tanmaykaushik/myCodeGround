/*  SELF ASSESSMENT
		   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code?
		       Mark out of 10:   10
		       Reason: Specified all the constants on top.

		   2. Did I use easy-to-understand, meaningful CONSTANT names?
		       Mark out of 5:  5
		       Reason: All the constant are easily understandable
		    3. Did I format the CONSTANT names properly (in UPPERCASE)?
		       Mark out of 5: 5 
		   4. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
		       Mark out of 10:10 Yes. and if any confusion, comments are also added
		   5. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
		       Mark out of 10: 10 Yes
		   6. Did I indent the code appropriately?
		       Mark out of 10:  10
		   7. Did I read the input correctly from the user using (an) appropriate question(s)?
		       Mark out of 10:  10
		   8. Did I compute the answer correctly for all cases?
		       Mark out of 20:  20
		   9. Did I output the correct answer in the correct format (as shown in the examples)?
		       Mark out of 10:  10
		   10. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
		       Mark out of 10:  10
